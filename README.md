By Dr. priya Darshni .Universal human values are essential for leading a peaceful and meaningful life. These include the right understanding of relationships based on mutual respect and trust, finding happiness in small moments, and spending quality time with family and friends. Self-introspection, or having regular talk sessions with ourselves, helps us understand our thoughts and emotions better. It is equally important to spend time alone, which brings relaxation and emotional clarity. These values guide us to live with love, kindness, and balance. Practicing them daily helps us grow as responsible and compassionate individuals in society.

# Day 4 
**Universal Human Values** 

Desires are a part of life—like wearing nice clothes or eating tasty food—but not all desires are necessary. For example, eating fast food satisfies our taste but harms our health. Such habits are unhealthy. On the other hand, good food and natural living support our well-being. We must learn to follow our natural acceptance.Choosing health over desire, and listening to our inner understanding, helps us live a better and more balanced life—not just following what we see outside.
